# Keras-Implementation-of-1D-CNN-for-sentence-classification
This github repo uses keras 2.0 to create a 1D CNN for sentiment analysis from the IMDB dataset. 

#How to run the program 

```
git clone  https://github.com/Neoanarika/Keras-Implementation-of-1D-CNN-for-sentence-classification.git
cd Keras-Implementation-of-1D-CNN-for-sentence-classification
python cnn_classification2.py
```

#Footnotes 
1. The pretrain model I uploaded was only trained in 1 epoch I have not included the full 5 epochs yet. 
2. The model is evaluated using logloss not accuracy
